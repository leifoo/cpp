    "Learning C++ is an adventure of discovery, particularly because the language accommodates several programming paradigms, including <font color=blue>object-oriented programming</font>, <font color=blue>generic programming</font>, and the <font color=blue>traditional procedural programming</font>. Many features C++ has added to C, including the following:\n",
    "- Classes and objects\n",
    "- Inheritance\n",
    "- Polymorphism, virtual functions, and runtime type identification (RTTI)\n",
    "- Function overloading\n",
    "- Reference variables\n",
    "- Generic, or type-independent, programming, as provided by templates and the Standard Template Library (STL)\n",
    "- The exception mechanism for handling error conditions\n",
    "- Namespaces for managing names of functions, classes, and variables\n",

    "## The Primer Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Philosophy:\n",
    "- A primer should be an easy-to-use, friendly guide. \n",
    "- A primer doesn't assume that you are already familiar with all relevant programming concepts.\n",
    "- A primer emphasizes hands-on learning with brief, easily typed examples that develop your understanding, a concept or two at a time.\n",
    "- A primer clarifies concepts with illustrations.\n",
    "- A primer provides questions and exercises to let you test your understanding, making the book suitable for self-learning or for the classroom.\n",
