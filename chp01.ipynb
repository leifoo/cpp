    "C++ blends the C language with support for object-oriented programming and for generic programming, became one of the most important programming languages of the 1990s and continues strongly in the 2000s. Its C ancestry brings to C++ the tradition of an efficient, compact, fast, and portable language. Its object-oriented heritage brings C++ a fresh programming methodology, designed to cope with the escalating complexity of modern programming tasks. Its template features bring yet another new programming methodology: generic programming.This triple heritage is both a blessing and a bane. It makes the language very powerful, but it also means there's a lot to learn.\n",

    "This chapter explores C++'s background further and then goes over some of the ground rules for creating C++ programs.The rest of the book teaches you to use the C++ language, going from the modest basics of the language to the glory of object-oriented programming (OOP) and its supporting cast of new jargon-objects, classes, encapsulation, data hiding, polymorphism, and inheritance-and then on to its support of generic programming. \n",

    "## Learning C++: What Lies Before You\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ joins three separate programming categories: the procedural language, represented by C; the object-oriented language, represented by the class enhancements C++ adds to C; and generic programming, supported by C++ templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Origins of C++: A Little History\n",
    "\n",
    "### The C Language\n",
    "\n",
    "1970s, Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories was developing the Unix operating system, which needed a language that was concise, that produced compact, fast programs, and that could control hardware efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, programmers met these needs by using assembly language, which is closely tied to a computer's internal machine language. However, assembly language is a low-level language-that is, it works directly with the hardware (for instance, accessing CPU registers and memory locations directly).Thus, assembly language is specific to a particular computer processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Unix was intended to work on a variety of computer types (or platforms).That suggested using a high-level language.A _high-level_ language is oriented toward problem solving instead of toward specific hardware. Special programs called _compilers_ translate a high-level language to the internal language of a particular computer.Thus, you can use the same high-level language program on different platforms by using a separate compiler for each platform. Ritchie wanted a language that combined low-level efficiency and hardware access with high-level generality and portability. So building from older languages, he created C.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C Programming Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, computer languages deal with two concepts: data and algorithms. The _data_ constitutes the information a program uses and processes. The _algorithms_ are the methods the program uses. Like most mainstream languages when C was created, C is a _procedural_ language.That means it emphasizes the algorithm side of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more disciplined style of programming called _structured programming_.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Top-down_ design was another of the new principles. C's design facilitates this approach, encouraging you to develop program units called _functions_ to represent individual task modules. The structured programming techniques reflect a procedural mind-set, thinking of a program in terms of the actions it performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The C++ Shift: Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike procedural programming, which emphasizes algorithms, OOP emphasizes the data. Rather than try to fit a problem to the procedural approach of a language, OOP attempts to fit the language to the problem. The idea\n",
    "is to design data forms that correspond to the essential features of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, a _class_ is a specification describing such a new data form, and an _object_ is a particular data structure constructed according to that plan. In general, a class defines what data is used to represent an object and the operations that can be performed on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OOP approach to program design is to first design classes that accurately represent those things with which the program deals. The class definitions, recall, include a description of permissible operations for each class.Then you would proceed to design a program, using objects of those classes.The process of going from a lower level of organization, such as classes, to a higher level, such as program design, is called _bottom-up_ programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's more to OOP than the binding of data and methods into a class definition. For example, OOP facilitates creating reusable code, and that can eventually save a lot of work. Information hiding safeguards data from improper access. Polymorphism lets you create multiple definitions for operators and functions, with the programming context determining which definition is used. Inheritance lets you derive new classes from old\n",
    "ones.As you can see, OOP introduces many new ideas and involves a different approach to programming than does procedural programming. Instead of concentrating on tasks, you concentrate on representing concepts. Instead of taking a top-down programming approach, you sometimes take a bottom-up approach. This book will guide you through\n",
    "all these points, with plenty of easily grasped examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing a useful, reliable class can be a difficult task. Fortunately, OOP languages make it simple to incorporate existing classes into your own programming. Vendors provide a variety of useful class libraries, including libraries of classes designed to simplify creating programs for environments such as Windows or the Macintosh. One of the real benefits of C++ is that it lets you easily reuse and adapt existing, well-tested code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C++ and Generic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic programming is yet another programming paradigm supported by C++. It shares with OOP the aim of making it simpler to reuse code and the technique of abstracting general concepts. But whereas OOP emphasizes the data aspect of programming, generic programming emphasizes independence from a particular data type. And its focus is different. OOP is a tool for managing large projects, whereas generic programming provides tools for performing common tasks, such as sorting data or merging lists. The term _generic_ refers to code that is type independent. C++ data representations come in many types: integers, numbers with fractional parts, characters, strings of characters, and user-defined compound structures of several types. If, for example, you wanted to sort data of these various types, you would normally have to create a separate sorting function for each type. Generic programming involves extending the language so that you can write a function for a generic (that is, an unspecified) type once and use it for a variety of actual types. C++ templates provide a mechanism for doing that.\n",

    "## The Mechanics of Creating a Program\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a text editor to write the program and save it in a file.This file constitutes the _source code_ for your program.\n",
    "2. Compile the source code.This means running a program that translates the source code to the internal language, called _machine language_, used by the host computer. The file containing the translated program is the _object code_ for your program.\n",
    "3. Link the object code with additional code. For example, C++ programs normally use libraries.A C++ library contains object code for a collection of computer routines, called _functions_, to perform tasks such as displaying information onscreen or calculating the square root of a number. Linking combines your object code with object code for the functions you use and with some standard startup code to produce a runtime version of your program.The file containing this final product is called the _executable code_.\n",

By default, the executable file is called a.out . If you used just one source file, the linker also deletes the spiffy.o file because it's no longer needed.\n",

    "Usually, the IDE lets you run the program in an auxiliary window. Some IDEs close the window as soon as the program finishes execution, and some leave it open. If your compiler closes the window, you'll have a hard time seeing the output unless you have quick eyes and a photographic memory.To see the output, you must place some additional code at the end of the program:\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The C language incorporated features such as control structures and functions to better control the flow of a program and to enable a more structured, modular approach.To these tools C++ adds support for object-oriented\n",
    "programming and generic programming.This enables even more modularity and facilitates the creation of reusable code, which saves time and increases program reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of C++ has resulted in a large number of implementations for many computing platforms; the C++ ISO standards (C++98/03 and C++11) provide a basis for keeping these many implementations mutually compatible.The standards establishes the features the language should have, the behavior the language should display, and a\n",
    "standard library of functions, classes, and templates. The standards supports the goal of a portable language across different computing platforms and different implementations of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a C++ program, you create one or more source files containing the program as expressed in the C++ language. These are text files that must be compiled and linked to produce the machine-language files that constitute executable programs. These tasks are often accomplished in an IDE that provides a text editor for creating the source files, a compiler and a linker for producing executable files, and other resources, such as project management and debugging capabilities. But the same tasks can also be performed in a command-line environment by invoking the appropriate tools individually.\n",
