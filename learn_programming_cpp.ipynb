    "\n",
    "Variables must be declared before they are used\n",
    "\n",
    "Built in types are not initialized for you\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler enforces a number of rules of rules related to type\n",

    "### Type safety\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ enforces type\n",
    "- Variables have type\n",
    "- Expressions have type\n",

    "## 3. Functions and Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Must be declared before called\n",
    "- By implementing, or just by declaring\n",

    "Have a return type\n",

    "Take parameters, which have a type and a name\n",

    "2. Forget to implement a function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing functions and calling them is better than a giant block of code\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be implemented in a separate .cpp file.\n",

    "### Lots of Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is a vital skill for all developers\n",
    "- Not just to find bugs\n",
    "- Understand flow of control\n",
    "- Watch values change\n",

    "- `dynamic_cast<>`\n",
    "- `const_cast<>`\n",
    "- `reinterpret_cast<>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `const` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "Promises the compiler that a variable's value won't change\n",
    "- Prevent logic errors\n",
    "- Enables optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "`const int amount = 90;`\n",
