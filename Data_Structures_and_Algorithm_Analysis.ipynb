    "# Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ by Mark Allen Weiss\n",

    "## Chapter 1: Programming: A General Overview\n",

    "### 1.1 What's This Book About?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Mathematics Review\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 A Brief Introduction to Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "First two fundamental rules of recursion:\n",
    "1. _Base cases_. You must always have some base cases, which can be solved without recursion.\n",
    "2. _Making progress_. For the cases that are to be solved recursively, the recursive call must always be to a case that makes progress toward a base case.\n",
    "3. _Design rule_. Assume that all the recursive calls work.\n",
    "4. _Compound interest rule_. Never duplicate work by solving the same instance of a problem in separate recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with recursion is the hidden bookkeeping costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 C++ Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the data structures will be objects that store data (usually a collection of identically typed items) and will provide functions that manipulate the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.1 Basic `class` Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Class consists of its __members__ and __member functions (methods)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance of a class is an _object_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information hiding: `public`, `private`\n",
    "\n",
    "In a class, all members are `private` by default, so the initial `public` is not optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "`constructor`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.2 Extra Constructor Syntax and Accessors\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Default Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initialization List\n",
    "\n",
    "List initialization does not allow narrowing\n",
    "- An integer cannot be converted to another integer that cannot hold its value. For example, char to int is allowed, but not int to char.\n",
    "- A floating-point value cannot be converted to another floating-point type that cannot hold its value. For example, float to double is allowed, but not double to float.\n",
    "- A floating-point value cannot be converted to an integer type.\n",
    "- An integer value cannot be converted to a floating-point type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only situation where = is preferred over {} is when using `auto` keyword to get the type determined by the initializer.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `explicit` Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "You should make all one-parameter constructors `explicit` to avoid behind-the-scenes type conversions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a one-parameter constructor defines an __implicit type conversion__, in which a temporary object is created that makes an assignment (or parameter to a function) compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constant Member Function\n",
    "\n",
    "__Accessor__: a member function that examines but does not change the state of its object.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Mutator__: a member function that changes the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, all member functions are mutators. To make a member function an accessor, we must add the keyword `const` after the closing parenthesis that ends the parameter type list."

    "\n",
    "#### 1.5.1 Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "A __pointer variable__ is a variable that stores the address where another object resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 3 illustrates the declaration of `m`. The `*` indicates that `m` is a pointer variable; it is allowed to point at an `IntCell` object. The value of `m` is the address of the object that it points at. `m` is uninitialized at this point. In C++, no such check is performed to verify that `m` is assigned a value prior to being used. The use of uninitialized pointers typically crashes programs, because they result in access of memory locations that do not exist. In general, it is a good idea to provide an initial value, either by combining lines 3 and 5, or by initializing `m` to the `nullptr` pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dynamic Object Creation\n",
    "Line 5 illustrates how objects can be created dynamically. In C++ `new` returns a pointer to the newly created object. In C++ there are several ways to create an object using its zero-parameter constructor. \n",
    "\n",
    ">`m = new IntCell( );   // OK`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    ">`m = new IntCell{ };   // C++11`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    ">`m = new IntCell;      // Preferred in this text`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Garbage Collection and delete\n",
    "When an object that is allocated by `new` is no longer referenced, the `delete` operation must be applied to the object (through a pointer). Otherwise, the memory that it consumes is lost (until the program terminates). This is known as a __memory leak__. One important rule is to not use `new` when an __automatic variable__ can be used instead. \n",

This essentially provides the same viewable behavior as call-by-value. This form of parameter passing is known as __call-by-reference-to-a-constant__ in C++, but as that is overly verbose and the `const` precedes the `&`, it is also known by the simpler terminology of __call-by-constant reference__."

What we see here is that `x=y` can be a copy if y is an lvalue, but a move if y is an rvalue.

This copy is done because, in general, return expressions could be rvalues (e.g., return `x+4`) and hence will not logically exist by the time the function call returns at line 13. But in this case, the return type is an lvalue that will exist long after the function call returns, since `arr` is the same as `vec`. The second implementation shown at lines 6-9 takes advantage of this and uses __return-by-constant-reference__ to avoid an immediate copy. However, the caller must also use a constant reference to access the return value, as shown at line 15; otherwise, there will still be a copy. The constant reference signifies that we do not want to allow changes to be made by the caller by using the return value; in this case it is needed since `arr` itself is a non-modifiable vector. An alternative is to use `auto &` at line 15 to declare `item3`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout this section, we have discussed instances in which C++11 allows the programmer to easily replace expensive copies with moves. Yet another example of this is the implementation of a swap routine. However, it is easy to see that there is no need to copy; what we actually want is to do moves instead of copies. In C++11, if the right-hand side of the assignment operator (or constructor) is an rvalue, then if the object supports moving, we can automatically avoid copies. In other words, if `vector<string>` supports efficient moving, and if at line 10 `x` were an rvalue, then\n",
    "x could be moved into `tmp`; similarly, if `y` was an rvalue at line 11, then it could be moved in to `x`. vector does indeed support moving; however, `x`, `y`, and `tmp` are all lvalues at lines 10, 11, 12 (remember, if an object has a name, it is an lvalue). Figure 1.15 shows how this problem is solved; an implementation of swap at lines 1–6 shows that we can use a cast to treat the right-hand side of lines 10-12 as rvalues. The syntax of a static cast is daunting; fortunately, function std::move exists that converts any lvalue (or rvalue) into an rvalue. Note that the name is misleading; `std::move` doesn't move anything; rather, it makes a value subject to be moved. Use of `std::move` is also shown in a revised implementation of `swap` at lines 8–13 of Figure 1.15. The swap function `std::swap` is also part of the Standard Library and will work for any type.\n",

    "#### 1.5.6 The Big-Five: Destructor, Copy Constructor, Move Constructor, Copy Assignment operator=, Move Assignment operator=\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++11, classes come with five special functions that are already written for you. These are the __destructor, copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, and move assignment operator__. Collectively these are the __big-five__. In many cases, you can accept the default behavior provided by the compiler for the big-five. Sometimes you cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Destructor\n",
    "The destructor is called whenever an object goes out of scope or is subjected to a `delete`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Copy Constructor and Move Constructor\n",
    "A copy constructor or move constructor is called in the following instances:\n",
    "- a declaration with initialization\n",
    "- an object passed using call-by-value (instead of by `&` or `const &`), should rarely be done anyway.\n",
    "- an object returned by value (instead of by `&` or `const &`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Copy Assignment and Move Assignment (`operator=`)\n",
    "The assignment operator is called when `=` is applied to two objects that have both been previously constructed. `lhs=rhs` is intended to copy the state of `rhs` into `lhs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defaults\n",
    "A class whose data members are `int`, `double`, `vector<int>`, `string`, and even `vector<string>` can accept the defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the class contains a single data member that is a pointer. This pointer points at a dynamically allocated object. The default destructor does nothing to data members that are pointers (for good reason-recall that we must `delete` ourselves). Furthermore, the copy constructor and copy assignment operator both copy the value of\n",
    "the pointer rather than the objects being pointed at. Thus, we will have two class instances that contain pointers that point to the same object. This is a so-called __shallow copy__. Typically, we would expect a __deep copy__, in which a clone of the entire object is made. Thus, as a result, when a class contains pointers as data members, and deep semantics are important, we typically must implement the destructor, copy assignment, and copy constructors ourselves. Doing so removes the move defaults, so we also must implement move assignment and the move constructor. As a general rule, either you accept the default for all five operations, or you should declare all five, and explicitly define, default (use the keyword `default`), or disallow each (use the keyword `delete`). Generally we will define all five."

    "So what we really need is for `operator[]` to return a constant reference for `from`, but a plain reference for `to`. In other words, we need two versions of `operator[]`, which differ only in their return types. Since member function const-ness (i.e., whether a function is an accessor or a mutator) is part of the signature, we can have the accessor version of operator[] return a constant reference, and have the mutator version return the simple reference."
